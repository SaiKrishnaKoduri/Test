Certainly, I'll incorporate "must" into the functional requirements:

*Functional Requirements for Project XYZ*

1. *The system SHALL authenticate user credentials.*
2. *The system SHALL encrypt and securely store user passwords.*
3. *The system SHALL provide a user interface for account creation.*
4. *The system SHALL allow users to reset their passwords through a secure process.*
5. *The system SHALL log user access and authentication attempts for security auditing.*

*6. The system SHOULD implement multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.*
7. *The system SHOULD provide real-time feedback on the strength of user-created passwords.*
8. *The system SHOULD allow users to customize their account settings, including notification preferences.*
9. *The system SHOULD enable users to link their accounts with external authentication providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).*
10. *The system SHOULD send email notifications for critical account activities (e.g., password changes, account deactivation).*

*11. The system MAY implement a biometric authentication feature for supported devices.*
12. *The system MAY provide users with the option to choose between light and dark themes in the user interface.*
13. *The system MAY offer a "Remember Me" functionality for convenient user login on trusted devices.*
14. *The system MAY allow users to export their account data in a downloadable format.*
15. *The system MAY integrate with third-party identity verification services for enhanced user verification.*

*Negative Requirements:*

17. *The system SHALL NOT share user data with third parties without explicit user consent.*
18. *The system SHALL NOT allow more than three consecutive failed login attempts within a five-minute window.*

Note: "Must" has been incorporated as "Shall" for consistency with RFC 2119.
